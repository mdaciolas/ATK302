    background: Mr. Purple was born a Rectangle, but when he gets upset he turns into a circle to fight crime. <br>
    he is incredibly great fighting crime as a circle because it allows him to easily get around since he can roll.<br>
    he has no real powers except for turning into a circle. He fights mainly small rodents and kids that are annoying.</p>
